# Oil & Gas Data Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Oil & Gas production data and presents key findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to transform raw production data into clear, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Objectives

* Clean and prepare raw Oil & Gas production data
* Analyze production trends across time, location, and commodity
* Develop an interactive dashboard for clear data visualization
* Highlight key performance insights for stakeholders

## Dataset

The dataset contains production-related attributes, including:

* Production Date
* State / Location (Onshore & Offshore)
* Commodity Type
* Production Volume

Data preparation involved correcting data types, handling missing values, standardizing categories, and restructuring the data for analysis.

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI
* Power Query
* Data analysis and visualization techniques

## Dashboard Highlights

* Production trends over time
* Comparison of onshore vs offshore production
* Production breakdown by state and commodity
* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Interactive filters for dynamic analysis

## Key Insights

* Clear trends and fluctuations in production over time
* Differences in production levels between locations
* Identification of top-performing commodities and states

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, and visualize industry data using Power BI, turning complex datasets into meaningful insights suitable for real-world Oil & Gas analysis.
